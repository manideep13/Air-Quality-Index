Predicting Air Quality Index by Machine learning methods and found best fit model

**Breif Description :**

Prediction of air quality is a challenging task because of the dynamic environment, unpredictability, and variability in space and time of pollutants. The grave consequences of air pollution on humans, animals, plants, monuments, climate, and environment call for consistent air quality monitoring and analysis, especially in developing countries. However, lesser attention for researchers has been observed for AQI prediction for India. In the present work, air pollution data of Indian cities for a tenure of five years are investigated by applying ML methods and found
