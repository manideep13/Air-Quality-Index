# Air-Quality-Index
Air is what keeps humans alive. Monitoring it and understanding its quality is of immense importance to our well-being.


**Brief Description :**

Prediction of air quality is a challenging task because of the dynamic environment, unpredictability, and variability in space and time of pollutants. The grave consequences of air pollution on humans, animals, plants, monuments, climate, and environment call for consistent air quality monitoring and analysis, especially in developing countries. However, lesser attention for researchers has been observed for AQI prediction for India. In the present work, air pollution data of Indian cities for a tenure of five years are investigated by applying ML methods.Random Forest method gave highest R squared value and Support Vector gave least R squared value.
